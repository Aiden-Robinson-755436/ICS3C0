Predict:

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

print(add(7, 2))

I predict that it'll output "9" because "add" would suggest we are adding numbers,
return "a+b" confirms that and in the print statement 7 and 2 are mentioned.

By changing the code as such below

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

print(add('hi', 'bye'))

It will still try to add the strings, giving the output "hibye"

By changing the code to mix data types like below

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

print(add('hi', 3))

The program crashes.

Modify

infinity = float('inf')
neginfinity = float('-inf')

a=0
b=0
a = float(a)
b = float(b)
counter = 0
counter = float(counter)
counter2 = 0
counter2 = float(counter2)

while (counter == 0):
 try:
     a = float(input('Please input first number: '))
     counter = counter + 1
     
 except ValueError:
     print('Wrong input, try again with a number.')

while (counter2 == 0):
 try:
     b = float(input('Please input second number: '))
     counter2 = counter2 + 1
      
 except ValueError:
     print('Wrong input, try again with a number.')


if (a >= neginfinity) and (a <= infinity):
  if (b >= neginfinity) and (b <= infinity):

   
    def multiply(a, b):
     return a * b

    print("Your answer is: ", (multiply(a, b)))

Modify 2

import math

def myPow(a, b):
  return math.pow(a, b)

print(myPow(5, 2))

Result : 25.0
