# TASK A

# 1.

print("Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!")
print("It's possible Sanjay can distribute ", 12)
print(" cookies for each bowl.")


# 2.

# I predict the output to be as follows

Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!
It's possible Sanjay can distribute  12
 cookies for each bowl.

# 3.

# My prediction was correct.

# 4.

# To fix the space around the 12, I'd remove the space after "distribute"

print("It's possible Sanjay can distribute", 12)

# Python adds a space automatically, so this is not needed.

# TASK B

print("Sanjay has", 6, "bowls for", 144, "cookies.")

# TASK C

number = 12*2
print("The number of cookies per bowl is:", number)

print("There are ", 28, " people in this room.");
print("Your total money spent is: ", (2.75+9.32+11.91))

# This is helpful because you don't need to spend time doing math yourself.

print("There are %d people in this room." % 28)

# I don't understand how this is more efficient than a variable.

print("Pi is equal to %f" % 3.1416)

# This definetly has practical application for rounding.

print("%s's final score is %d" % ("Joe", 215))

# This could help for making large databases of info.

print("Total money spent is: %.2f" % (2.75+9.32+11.91))

# This is helpful because it rounds to 2 decimal places, making it good for money.

print("The area of a circle of radius %d is %f" % (4, 3.1416*4*4)

# This is once again helpful, doing the math and rounding it for you.
