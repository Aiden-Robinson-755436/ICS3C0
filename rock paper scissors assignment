   Program : Rock, Paper, Scissors Assignment
   Description : A program to play rock paper scissors with a computer opponent
   VARIABLE DICTIONARY :
     counter (int) = counts the rounds played so they can be compared to games variable to end loop
     playerpoint (int) = stores the players points
     robotpoint (int) = stores the programs points
     roundcounter (int) = counts the rounds played so far to give a visual indicator which round you're on
     games (int) = selected amount of games the player chose, also used to compared with counter to end the loop
     after the amount of games has been played
     rules (string) = stores the answer to if the player wants to read the rules or not.
     holder (int) = is where the number of games is originally held, so we can check if its an integer or not
     before putting it into the "games" variable
     player (string) = player choice (R, P, S)
     robot (int) = robot choice (1, 2, 3)
