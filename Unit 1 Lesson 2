# 1. Predict.

# Look at the code below in the green box. In your reflection, predict what output you would expect from the statement.

print(24)

# I'd expect the output to be "24"


# 2. Run

# The output was as I expected and printed 24.


# 3. Modify

amount = 24
print(amount)

print("Two dozen is", amount)

# Printing it like this allows you to change the variable, or allow users to input their own variable.

# 4. Modify 2

amount = 7*4
print("Seven times four is equal to", amount)

# 5. Modify 3

amount = 8
amount = amount + 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)

# This is assigning the original "amount" to 8, then reassigning "amount" to 9, by adding 1 to the original value. It then prints the final amount after the math.

amount = 8
amount += 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)

# This code has the same output, however its compacted into "amount += 1", changing the 1 will also change how much is added. Changing the "+" to a "-" makes it remove the amount instead of adding it.


# 6. Modify 4

amount = 8
amount = amount * 2
print(amount)

# This will take the amount variable's value (8), and times it by the number specified (2). It will print 16.

# Modifying the code to be similar to our earlier code as below


amount = 8
amount *= 2
print(amount)

# This has the same output. It's the same as our code earlier, where we said +=, just with multiplication. I can assume this would also work for divison or other types of math.
