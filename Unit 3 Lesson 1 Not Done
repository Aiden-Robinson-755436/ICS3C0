Predict:

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

print(add(7, 2))

I predict that it'll output "9" because "add" would suggest we are adding numbers,
return "a+b" confirms that and in the print statement 7 and 2 are mentioned.

By changing the code as such below

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

print(add('hi', 'bye'))

It will still try to add the strings, giving the output "hibye"

By changing the code to mix data types like below

def add(a, b):
  return a + b

print(add('hi', 3))

The program crashes.

Modify

try:
    a = float(input('Please input a number: '))

except ValueError:
    print('Wrong input, try again with a number.')

try:
    b = float(input('Please input a number: '))

except ValueError:
    print('Wrong input, try again with a number.')

infinity = float('inf')
neginfinity = float('-inf')

if (a >= neginfinity) and (a <= infinity):
  a = float(a)
  if (b >= neginfinity) and (b <= infinity):
    b = float(b)
   
    def multiply(a, b):
     return a * b

    print("Your answer is: ", (multiply(a, b)))
