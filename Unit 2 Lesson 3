Part A

count = 9
while (count != 0):
    print(count)
    count -= 1

This will print "9" and slowly remove one from it each time it loops and reprint the new result and repeat.

My prediction is correct.

Modify 1

count = 9
while (count != 0):
    count -= 1
    print(count)

It will have the same result, but it will start at 8 and end on zero.

Part B

num = input("Please enter a whole number greater than zero: ")
num = int(num)

count = 0
count = int(count)
tot = 0
tot = int(tot)

while (count < num):
    count = count + 1
    tot = tot + count
    
    
print("Triangular number ",num ," is equal to", tot)


Modify:

num = input("Please enter a whole number greater than zero: ")
num = int(num)
print(" ")
count = 0
count = int(count)
tot = 0
tot = int(tot)
counter = 0
counter = int(counter)

while (count < num):
    counter += 1
    count = count + 1
    tot = tot + count

    print("The",counter, "triangular number is", tot)
