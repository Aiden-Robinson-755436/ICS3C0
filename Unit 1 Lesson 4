# 1. Predict

# I predict the following

Please input a whole number
(user input 3 to finish prediction)

When 3 is divided by 6 the result is 0.5

# 2. Run

The code worked as I predicted

# 3. Inspect

# It stopped executing when asking for a user input and waited for the user's number. 

# I input the number 3, and it returned me 0.5. The output was the same as my calculator.

# 4. Modify

num = input("Please input a whole number: ") 
num2 = input("Please input any whole number except 0: ")
num = int(num) 
num2 = int(num2)
num3 = num / num2
print("When", num, " is divided by", num2, "the result is:", num3)

# Dividing by 0 makes python crash because you cant divide by 0
